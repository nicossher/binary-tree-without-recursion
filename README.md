# Binary Tree Without Recursion in C++
This project demonstrates the visualization of a binary tree without using recursion. It employs stacks and pointers to achieve the traversal and display of the binary tree structure.

### Features:
- Load a binary tree structure.
- Traverse the binary tree without recursion.
- Traverse the binary tree without recursion.
- Implement tree manipulation functionalities.

### Technologies:
- C++ programming language

### How to Use:
- Clone the repository containing the C++ source code.
- Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
- Execute the compiled program.

### Note:
Ensure that you have a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile the source code.

Feel free to expand and enhance the project according to your requirements and preferences!
